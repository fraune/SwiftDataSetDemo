# SwiftDataSetDemo

## Background

This is a sample project I created for a StackOverflow question. I created this repo to simplify an issue I'm experiencing on a large project.

The issue is a crash on launch, when using a SwiftData model which contains a Set of another model.

## Setup

To get started, you might need to set your `Team` under the `SwiftDataSetDemo` target > `Signing & Capabilities` section.
